# README for sms-canvas-todo-list.sh

This folder contains a shell script that can help you automate sending (or receiving) daily assginment notifications from Canvas LMS, via SMS using Twilio. 

The script requires custom inputs in many places to work for your own personal use case, as well as a Twilio account that can send SMS, and a mechanism to trigger the script at a regular time. I have added [instructions](instructions.md) in this folder covering how to setup all of this and possible alternatives.
