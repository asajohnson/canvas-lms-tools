# README for sms-canvas-todo-list.sh

Why fuss with setting reminders to manually check into your Canvas app to know what you need to do? Or, to check into each one of your kids Canvas accounts to check what they need to do and then remind/nag them to get it done?

This folder contains a shell script that can help you automate sending (and receiving) daily assginment notifications from Canvas LMS via SMS, using Twilio. 

The script requires custom inputs in many places to work for your own personal use case, as well as a Twilio account that can send SMS, and a mechanism to trigger the script at a regular time. I have added [instructions](instructions.md) in this folder covering how to setup all of this and possible alternatives.
