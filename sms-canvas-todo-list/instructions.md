# How to setup the infrastructure in this project to automate a daily notification via SMS of the Canvas LMS TODO list using Twilio

## Prerequisites

In order to implement these instructions, you must:

* Have a Twilio account that can send SMS (if you don't have this, reference the [Twilio account setup instructions](twilio-account-setup-instructions.md) in this folder)

## High-level process

The high-level process we're going to walk through is:

1. Find your Twilio account credentials and phone number
2. Find your Canvas API credentials
3. Find your Canvas API course IDs
4. Customize the sms-canvas-todo-list shell script with your information
5. Setup a task to run the script at a regular time each day
